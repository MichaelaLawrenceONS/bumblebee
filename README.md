useful nlp functions for text mining in a package format


<br>

<br>


## Getting Started

TODO:These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What package prerequsites you need to install the software ? See [requirements.txt](https://github.com/mamonu/textconsultations/blob/master/requirements.txt) 


How to install those prerequisite packages if I need to?

go to main directory and run 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
python -m nltk.downloader all

```

after downloading these packages/ and their assorted material (in the case of NLTK) everything should run smoothly 



### Installing

TODO:A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

In order to run all the automated tests for this system after you have cloned it into your system just do:

```
cd tests

pytest

```
